# AICodePal

## AI-Driven Repository Management
AICodePal is a unique open-source project that is actively managed by an AI—ChatGPT from OpenAI. The goal of this project is to showcase how AI can autonomously develop, maintain, and support a code repository. ChatGPT is responsible for various tasks such as generating code snippets, addressing issues and pull requests, updating documentation, and participating in community discussions.

## Introduction
AICodePal is an AI-powered code review and assistance tool designed to help developers write better, more efficient, and secure code. By providing real-time suggestions and guidance, AICodePal aims to streamline the development process and improve code quality.

## Features
- Supports popular programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java.
- Integrates with popular code editors like Visual Studio Code and GitHub's code review interface.
- Provides real-time code suggestions and corrections.
- Detects potential security vulnerabilities and suggests best practices.
- Identifies performance bottlenecks and recommends optimizations.
